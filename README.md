The Galileo Network Analytics Toolkit is ***a relatively new project*** that aims to provide a robust microservices-oriented framework for building network 
data pipelines specifically tailored for cybersecurity operations. Built with modularity and scalability at its core, this toolkit is designed to empower security teams to construct robust threat hunting and anomaly detection stacks that can adapt to evolving security landscapes.

## Unix Philosophy
Galileo embraces the core principle of building Unix command-line interfaces (CLI): create small, focused programs that do one thing well and can be combined to accomplish more complex tasks. This philosophy, known as the Unix philosophy, emphasizes modularity, simplicity, and the use of text streams as a universal interface. By applying these principles to cybersecurity analytics, Galileo allows teams to build sophisticated solutions from composable, single-purpose commandline clients that can be orchestrated together to create powerful workflows. This approach enables high availability, fault tolerance, and the ability to integrate seamlessly with existing security infrastructure while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Use Cases

Galileo is particularly well-suited for security operations centers (SOCs), managed security service providers (MSSPs), and security teams looking to enhance their threat detection capabilities. The stack supports near real-time monitoring, historical data analysis, and proactive threat hunting initiatives, making it valuable for both reactive and proactive security measures.
